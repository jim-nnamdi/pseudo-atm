# CLI ATM

> Note: you can run as docker container (un-tested yet but works) and can also run it independently, just run the command in the ```atm.sh``` file or ```"clang++ -std=c++17 atm.cpp -o atm"```

> A single file for simple cli ATM built in c++ .. this serves as a guideline to a major project.
